			<h1>Pros</h1>
			<p>Computers increase your productivity and, with a good understanding of the software running on them, you become more productive at everything you do. For example, once you have a basic understanding of using a word processor, you can create, store, edit, share, and print documents and letters. Each of these tasks was either impossible or slower with all pre-existing technologies.</p>

		<div class="cons">
